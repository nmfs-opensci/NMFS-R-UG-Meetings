# README

This session will be an easy intro to using `reticulate` to run Python code in R. We will focus on the `py_require()` function for light-weight
Python uses.

The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:

* Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.

* Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).

* Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.

* Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability.
